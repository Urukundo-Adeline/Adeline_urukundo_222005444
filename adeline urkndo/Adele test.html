Introduction
this project of online customer feedback collection, refers to the process of gathering feedback and opinions through online channels. This feedback helps businesses most especially ITOTO Hotel to get insights into customer satisfaction , identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance their products or services.
1.	Statement of the problem
In current manual feedback delivery, there is lack of communication channels 
There is lack of systematic and efficient method to gather and analyze customer feedback. Currently, our hotel relies on sporadic and informational customer sentiments effectively. This hinders our ability to identify areas for improvement feedback collection methods, such as email or phone calls, which makes it difficult to track and analyze and make data-driven decisions to enhance our services. Therefore, our goal is to implement a structural feedback collection system that allows us to gather, organize and analyze  customer feedback in a more streamlined and comprehensive manner.
2.1	Description of the existing system 
The existing system was primarily focused on providing services to customers without a formalized process offer gathering and analyzing customer feedback. The primary goal of the system was to deliver services to customers efficiently and ensure customer satisfaction. It likely included features such as services listing, online ordering, payment processing customer support channels and delivery fulfillment mechanisms 
In short the existing system focused primarily on transactional aspects of customer interaction, while feedback collection and analysis were not given adequate attention  the customer feedback collection project aimed to address this gap and introduce systematic approach to gather , analyses and act upon customer feedback for continuous improvement

2.2 Problems of the current system
One of the current problems of the system is lack of a structured and efficient method for collecting and analyzing customer feedback. Without a proper feedback collection system in place, the hotel may struggle to gather relevant and timely feedback from customers, which can hinder their ability to understand customer needs and preferences.
Due to lack of a systematic approach to collecting feedback, valuable insights and actionable data may be missed or overlooked . this ca lead to missed opportunities for improving our services as well as social disconnect between the hotel and customers.
In short, the absence of a robust customer feedback collection system ca impede the company’s ability to listen to its customers, understand their needs and make inform decisions based on their feedback.

(Continued in the next response for Sections IV, V, and VI)

Section IV
Under this section of creating stored procedure I assume to use Products table as sample for creating stored procedure for all my tables. Here there is screenshot to prove it.
 

After exciting Stored procedure, it shows this results.
 


1.	Customer with columns CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, and Phone.
2.	Product with columns ProductID, ProductName, and Description.
3.	Feedback with columns FeedbackID, Description, Rating, Date, CustomerID, ProductID, and CategoryID.
4.	FeedbackCategory with columns CategoryID and Name.
You can create a stored procedure to insert feedback data as follows (using SQL Server syntax):
sqlCopy code
-- Create a stored procedure to insert feedback data CREATE PROCEDURE InsertFeedback @FirstName VARCHAR(50), @LastName VARCHAR(50), @Email VARCHAR(100), @Phone VARCHAR(20), @ProductName VARCHAR(100), @ProductDescription VARCHAR(255), @FeedbackDescription VARCHAR(1000), @Rating INT, @FeedbackDate DATE, @CategoryName VARCHAR(50) AS BEGIN DECLARE @CustomerID INT; DECLARE @ProductID INT; DECLARE @CategoryID INT; -- Insert into Customer table INSERT INTO Customer (FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone) VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName, @Email, @Phone); -- Get the newly generated CustomerID SET @CustomerID = SCOPE_IDENTITY(); -- Insert into Product table INSERT INTO Product (ProductName, Description) VALUES (@ProductName, @ProductDescription); -- Get the newly generated ProductID SET @ProductID = SCOPE_IDENTITY(); -- Check if the FeedbackCategory exists, if not, insert it IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM FeedbackCategory WHERE Name = @CategoryName) BEGIN INSERT INTO FeedbackCategory (Name) VALUES (@CategoryName); END -- Get the CategoryID SELECT @CategoryID = CategoryID FROM FeedbackCategory WHERE Name = @CategoryName; -- Insert into Feedback table INSERT INTO Feedback (Description, Rating, Date, CustomerID, ProductID, CategoryID) VALUES (@FeedbackDescription, @Rating, @FeedbackDate, @CustomerID, @ProductID, @CategoryID); END

2. sqlCopy code
-- Create a stored procedure to display all information CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllData AS BEGIN -- Retrieve data from the Customer table SELECT * FROM Customer; -- Retrieve data from the Product table SELECT * FROM Product; -- Retrieve data from the Feedback table, including related Customer, Product, and Category information SELECT F.FeedbackID, F.Description AS FeedbackDescription, F.Rating, F.Date, C.CustomerID, C.FirstName, C.LastName, C.Email, C.Phone, P.ProductID, P.ProductName, P.Description AS ProductDescription, FC.CategoryID, FC.Name AS CategoryName FROM Feedback F INNER JOIN Customer C ON F.CustomerID = C.CustomerID INNER JOIN Product P ON F.ProductID = P.ProductID INNER JOIN FeedbackCategory FC ON F.CategoryID = FC.CategoryID; END 
In this stored procedure:
•	The GetAllData procedure fetches data from the Customer table, Product table, and Feedback table.
•	For the Feedback table, it retrieves related information from the Customer, Product, and FeedbackCategory tables by using JOIN operations.
•	The results of these queries will be displayed when you execute the stored procedure.

3. sqlCopy code
-- Create a stored procedure to update customer information CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateCustomer @CustomerID INT, @FirstName VARCHAR(50), @LastName VARCHAR(50), @Email VARCHAR(100), @Phone VARCHAR(20) AS BEGIN UPDATE Customer SET FirstName = @FirstName, LastName = @LastName, Email = @Email, Phone = @Phone WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID; END 
In this stored procedure:
•	@CustomerID is the parameter for specifying which customer to update.
•	@FirstName, @LastName, @Email, and @Phone are parameters for the updated customer information.
To execute this stored procedure and update customer information, you can use the following SQL command:
sqlCopy code
EXEC UpdateCustomer @CustomerID = 1, -- Provide the specific CustomerID you want to update @FirstName = 'NewFirstName', @LastName = 'NewLastName', @Email = 'new.email@example.com', @Phone = '123-456-7890';

4. sqlCopy code
-- Create a stored procedure to delete data CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteData AS BEGIN -- Delete customers with no feedback DELETE FROM Customer WHERE CustomerID NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT C.CustomerID FROM Customer C LEFT JOIN Feedback F ON C.CustomerID = F.CustomerID WHERE F.CustomerID IS NOT NULL ); -- Delete products with no feedback DELETE FROM Product WHERE ProductID NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT P.ProductID FROM Product P LEFT JOIN Feedback F ON P.ProductID = F.ProductID WHERE F.ProductID IS NOT NULL ); END

5. sqlCopy code
-- Create a stored procedure to create a view with a subquery CREATE PROCEDURE CreateAverageRatingView AS BEGIN -- Check if the view already exists and drop it if it does IF OBJECT_ID('AverageRatingView', 'V') IS NOT NULL BEGIN DROP VIEW AverageRatingView; END -- Create a view to display the average rating for each product CREATE VIEW AverageRatingView AS SELECT P.ProductID, P.ProductName, AVG(F.Rating) AS AverageRating FROM Product P LEFT JOIN Feedback F ON P.ProductID = F.ProductID GROUP BY P.ProductID, P.ProductName; END

Section V
1.	1. AFTER INSERT Trigger for the Order Table:
Suppose you have an Order table with columns such as OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, and TotalAmount. You can create an "AFTER INSERT" trigger that calculates the total number of orders placed by a customer and updates the customer's order count in a separate Customer table:
sqlCopy code
-- Create an AFTER INSERT trigger for the Order table CREATE TRIGGER UpdateOrderCount AFTER INSERT ON [Order] FOR EACH ROW BEGIN DECLARE customer_id INT; -- Get the CustomerID from the newly inserted order SET customer_id = NEW.CustomerID; -- Update the Customer table to increment the order count UPDATE Customer SET OrderCount = OrderCount + 1 WHERE CustomerID = customer_id; END; 
In this trigger:
•	The trigger is named UpdateOrderCount and is set to execute "AFTER INSERT" on the Order table.
•	For each newly inserted row (order), it calculates the total number of orders placed by the associated customer and updates the OrderCount column in the Customer table accordingly.
2.	AFTER INSERT Trigger for the Inventory Table:
Assuming you have an Inventory table with columns like ProductID, ProductName, QuantityInStock, and LastRestocked, you can create an "AFTER INSERT" trigger that updates the LastRestocked column whenever new inventory is added:
sqlCopy code
-- Create an AFTER INSERT trigger for the Inventory table CREATE TRIGGER UpdateLastRestocked AFTER INSERT ON Inventory FOR EACH ROW BEGIN DECLARE product_id INT; -- Get the ProductID from the newly inserted inventory SET product_id = NEW.ProductID; -- Update the Inventory table to set the LastRestocked date to the current timestamp UPDATE Inventory SET LastRestocked = NOW() WHERE ProductID = product_id; END;

1.	2. AFTER UPDATE Trigger for the Employee Table:
Suppose you have an Employee table with columns like EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, and LastSalaryChangeDate. You can create an "AFTER UPDATE" trigger that updates the LastSalaryChangeDate whenever an employee's salary is updated:
sqlCopy code
-- Create an AFTER UPDATE trigger for the Employee table CREATE TRIGGER UpdateLastSalaryChangeDate AFTER UPDATE ON Employee FOR EACH ROW BEGIN -- Check if the Salary column was updated IF NEW.Salary <> OLD.Salary THEN -- Update the LastSalaryChangeDate to the current timestamp UPDATE Employee SET LastSalaryChangeDate = NOW() WHERE EmployeeID = NEW.EmployeeID; END IF; END; 
In this trigger:
•	The trigger is named UpdateLastSalaryChangeDate and is set to execute "AFTER UPDATE" on the Employee table.
•	It checks if the Salary column was updated (by comparing NEW.Salary to OLD.Salary).
•	If the salary was indeed updated, it updates the LastSalaryChangeDate column to the current timestamp for the respective employee.
2.	AFTER UPDATE Trigger for the Sales Table:
Assuming you have a Sales table with columns like SaleID, ProductID, QuantitySold, and SaleDate, you can create an "AFTER UPDATE" trigger that logs changes to sales records in an audit table:
sqlCopy code
-- Create an AFTER UPDATE trigger for the Sales table CREATE TRIGGER LogSalesChanges AFTER UPDATE ON Sales FOR EACH ROW BEGIN -- Insert the old and new values of the updated record into the SalesAudit table INSERT INTO SalesAudit (SaleID, ProductID, QuantitySoldOld, QuantitySoldNew, SaleDateOld, SaleDateNew, ChangeDate) VALUES ( OLD.SaleID, OLD.ProductID, OLD.QuantitySold, NEW.QuantitySold, OLD.SaleDate, NEW.SaleDate, NOW() ); END;

1.	3. AFTER DELETE Trigger for the Orders Table:
Suppose you have an Orders table with columns such as OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, and TotalAmount. You can create an "AFTER DELETE" trigger that logs deleted orders into an audit table:
sqlCopy code
-- Create an AFTER DELETE trigger for the Orders table CREATE TRIGGER LogDeletedOrders AFTER DELETE ON Orders FOR EACH ROW BEGIN -- Insert the deleted order into the DeletedOrdersAudit table INSERT INTO DeletedOrdersAudit (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, DeletionDate) VALUES (OLD.OrderID, OLD.CustomerID, OLD.OrderDate, OLD.TotalAmount, NOW()); END; 
In this trigger:
•	The trigger is named LogDeletedOrders and is set to execute "AFTER DELETE" on the Orders table.
•	It inserts the deleted order (record) into a DeletedOrdersAudit table along with the deletion date.
2.	AFTER DELETE Trigger for the Customers Table:
Assuming you have a Customers table with columns like CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, and Email, you can create an "AFTER DELETE" trigger that deletes related records in another table, such as CustomerHistory, when a customer is deleted:
sqlCopy code
-- Create an AFTER DELETE trigger for the Customers table CREATE TRIGGER DeleteRelatedCustomerHistory AFTER DELETE ON Customers FOR EACH ROW BEGIN -- Delete related records in the CustomerHistory table DELETE FROM CustomerHistory WHERE CustomerID = OLD.CustomerID; END;
